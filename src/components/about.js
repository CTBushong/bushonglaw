              With a background in economics and management consulting prior to pursuing a career in law, 
              I am uniquely positioned to use quantitative methods and a real-world business outlook to 
              help clients make optimal decisions. My legal experience includes in-house tax work at a 
              Fortune 20 tech firm, stints at boutique and large tax and accounting firms, tax software 
              development at a major tax technology company, and private practice. I have advised globally 
              recognized companies and the smallest of small businesses, and my goal is to ensure that all 
              of my clients receive the same caliber of high-quality advice.
